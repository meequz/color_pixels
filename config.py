resx = 400
resy = 300
pix_q = 500						#~ pixel quantity
pix_around_q = 10				#~ quantity of pixels around family from which is average value calculating
prev_pix_q = int(pix_q / 2)		#~ how many pixs in every pix's memory of previous families
backcolor = (2, 2, 2)			#~ background color
scale = 2						#~ scale of the screen
everyframe = 1					#~ what frames are for drawing



#~ TODO:
#~	- gui with pause, reset buttons, etc
#~	- scale 3x
#~	- output of frame number in one line
#~	- around average have the effect on changing color. So if red fighting with green, the result bunch will have the red or the green color, or almost red or green, mot average between two colors.
